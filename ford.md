The uEMEP (urban EMEP) model was created to extend the EMEP MSC-W model's application to near-street-level air quality modeling. It uses a downscaling approach based on classical Gaussian plume modeling, which is combined with the physical parameterization and emission data from the EMEP MSC-W model.
